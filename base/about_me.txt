Hi! I'm Calvin I am a former physics major at the College of Wooster
taking CSCI240 for interest. I'm currently a software tester at a healthcare 
engagement platform company called Healthx and want to expand my programming 
knowledge. My goal is to get a masters in applied data science but felt I 
needed some classical programming fundementals in order to help with that. 
I see a need for understanding how users behave when interacting with their 
healthcare information in order to drive how products are built.

"I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see
What's goin' on? What's goin' on? (Somebody tell me) What's goin' on?"
